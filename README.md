# What is it ?

The Admiral is a program to manage a database of cards for the game [Pirates of the Spanish Main](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Spanish_Main). If you don't know what this is, you probably don't want to be here. It's a fun game, though - check it out.

# Instructions

Put the file admiral.jar in a directory of your choice. Once run, the program will create a data file in which it stores your preferences.

You need Java (version 6) to run this program. You can get it here : [http://www.java.com/en/download/](http://www.java.com/en/download/). Java is available for most major operating systems.

The Admiral is packaged as an executable jar file. This means that once java is installed, you should be able to double-click on the file to run it. Try it.

If this fails, you need to run the command "javaw -jar admiral.jar" in the directory you placed the file.
If this also fails, you need to find where the java executable is and run it explicitly: for example, c:\program files\java\j2re1.5\bin\javaw.exe -jar admiral.jar. Contact the developer for more help.

The help file for the application can be read [here](https://github.com/SR-G/theadmiral/blob/master/src/main/resources/help/help.html).
