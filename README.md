# What is it ?

The Admiral is a program to manage a database of cards for the game [Pirates of the Spanish Main](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Spanish_Main). If you don't know what this is, you probably don't want to be here. It's a fun game, though - check it out.

# Download

Get it there : http://potsm.tensin.org/downloads/theadmiral-1.4.0.jar

Images pack available here : http://potsm.tensin.org/downloads/potsm-images.zip (~145 mo, about 1954 images availables, 19 missings)

# Instructions

Put the file admiral.jar in a directory of your choice. Once run, the program will create a data file in which it stores your preferences.

Uncompress the images pack in the same directories (in a folder called "img/"). Once the images pack is uncompressed, you have something like "img/expansions/PotR/001.png" and so on.

You need Java (version 6) to run this program. You can get it here : [http://www.java.com/en/download/](http://www.java.com/en/download/). Java is available for most major operating systems.

The Admiral is packaged as an executable jar file. This means that once java is installed, you should be able to double-click on the file to run it. Try it.

If this fails, you need to run the command "javaw -jar theadmiral-1.4.0.jar" in the directory you placed the file.
If this also fails, you need to find where the java executable is and run it explicitly: for example, c:\program files\java\j2re1.5\bin\javaw.exe -jar theadmiral-1.4.0.jar. Contact the developer for more help.

The help file for the application can be read online [here](https://github.com/SR-G/theadmiral/blob/master/src/main/resources/help/help.html).
