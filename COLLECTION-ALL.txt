Ship	005	Cassandra	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	11	Uncommon	Once per turn, this ship may look at one face-down cargo on any ship.	Crimson Angel is fond of ancient history, so a ship called the Cassandra suits her nicely.

Ship	007	La Morte de Yarborough	1	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	10	Uncommon	On the turn this ship is pinned, eliminate one crew from the enemy ship.	While some pirates fly the skull and crossbones out of style, the crew of La Morte do so out of substance. After one of their own was killed savagely, they now feel it is their right that their hostages often have 'accidents' right after their ransoms are paid.	CC-007	3	4	L	2L,3S,3S	
Ship	008	Santiago	1	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	11	Uncommon	When this ship hits an enemy ship, you may also eliminate one cargo from that ship.

Ship	009	Amity	1	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	12	Uncommon	Ghost Ship.	The Amity left England bound for the West Indies, but she never arrived. If this is the same ship, it's a pretty safe bet that she doesn't have the same crew.	CC-009	3	4	S,S,S	5S,5S,5S	
Ship	010	Treasure	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	13	Common	Schooner. Forts cannot hit this ship.	Some say that naming a pirate ship 'the Treasure' is asking for trouble, but Captain Prentiss isn't worried: The ship's goods are stored in a warehouse in Lucina Harbor-not in her hold.	CC-010	3	3	S,S	2S,2S,2S	
Ship	011	Adventure	1	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	9	Common	Schooner. This ship gets +1 to her boarding rolls.

CC-012	3	4	L	4S,2L,4S	
Ship	013	Duke	1	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	15	Common	Schooner. L-range cannons cannot hit this ship.

Ship	014	Charles	1	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	9	Common	If this ship has a Captain crew, she gets +1 to her cannon rolls.

Ship	015	Bonnie Liz	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	8	Common	English crew may use their abilities on this ship.	Sailing under the secret patronage of Countess Doone, the commander of the Bonnie Liz is a relatively patriotic man who charges far less ransom for English prisoners than for others.	CC-015	2	5	S,L	3S,3S	
Ship	016	Royal James	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	8	Common	Schooner. Once per turn when this ship hits an enemy ship, also eliminate one crew from that ship.

Ship	017	Raven	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	10	Common	Schooner. This ship cannot be pinned.	Captain Parrish, a man of visions, says that Branwen the White Raven protects the ship, deflecting enemy fire with her invisible wings. His claim to fame: once drinking Jack Hawkins under the table.	CC-017	2	4	S,S,S	2S,2S	
Ship	018	Rover	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	2	Rare	This ship's base move becomes S when she reaches her cargo limit.

Ship	019	Fancy	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	5	Rare	You may double the range of this ship's cannons each turn, but you must roll a 6 to hit.	To keep his crew sharp, Captain Harrison has his crew practice on larger, less-agile ships like Ville de Paris, which he would love to wrest from the simpering Phillipe du Brissac.	CC-019	1	2	S,L	3L	
Ship	020	Mermaid	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	2	Rare	This ship cannot carry crew.	A tiny vessel with few crew, the Mermaid is the ideal bait for greedy vessels. A favorite tactic is to have the captain's sister, Maud, masquerade as a captured noblewoman.	CC-020	1	1	L,L	3S	
Ship	021	Scepter	1	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	14	Rare	Friendly ships within S of this ship get +1 to their cannon rolls.

CC-021	1	3	L,L	4S	
Crew	022	Geoffery Flores	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	6	Rare	Broadsides Attack. This ship may move and shoot using the same move action.	Flores signaled his resignation from the French Navy with the dead body of his superior officer, who referred to him as a half-breed. Captain Flores is ruthless to his prey but generous to his crew. gaston de St. Croix might have damned his soul, but Crimson Angel has shown him the gates of heaven.	CC-022	None	N/A
Crew	023	Crimson Angel	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	6	Rare	Once per turn, roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, this ship may be given an extra action.	A magnificent creature drenched in the blood of her enemies, Crimson Angel is from either heaven or hell, depending on your point of view. She attacks crowns and pirates alike, seemingly loyal to none but her own. Even then, she rewards betrayal with swift and deadly vengeance, but her word is legend on the Crimson Coast.	CC-023	None	N/A
Crew	024	Havana Black	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	5	Rare	This ship may move and shoot using the same move action. Once per turn, you may eliminate one of this ship's crew to give her an extra action.	Havana Black suffers no delinquency, and he revels in proving it with a cat-o-nine. Nothing raises Havana's ire faster than a slaver ship, and he particularly enjoys watching the crew of such a ship being put to the most horrible death possible-despite any pleas for leniency. It is said that even Blackheart fears this powerful ex-slave.	CC-024	Bloody Jake	N/A
Crew	025	Jack Hawkins	2	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	6	Common	Once per turn before you give this ship an action, roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, this ship may be given the same action twice. This ship's crew cannot be eliminated unless she sinks.	There are more stories about Jack Hawkins' adventures than seem possible given his age. He has taken more treasure and ships than any other pirate in the Caribbean, yet he is always broke and looking for a new ship. He courts only the most beautiful-and deadly-women, with more than his fair share of love-hate relationships, emphasis 'hate.'	CC-025	None	N/A
Crew	026	El Phantasma	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	5	Common	This ship may dock at an enemy home island and load one treasure. If able, she must leave on your next turn. If this crew is eliminated, place it on your home island.	Does a man seek the shadows or is he forced there by the machinations of others? Some whisper of a horrific betrayal, some of years spent isolated in a French prison, and others of unspeakable torture at the hands of the Moors. Whatever the truth, El Phantasma and his sepulchral crew do not intend to make amends for their crimes.	CC-026	None	N/A
Crew	027	The Hag of Tortuga	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	0	Common	Limit. Ransom. Place this crew face up during setup. You may build your fleet using 5 more points than the game's build total. This crew cannot leave this ship unless captured or eliminated.	Creole Amelie Lejeune, better known as the 'Hag of Tortuga' is a sea crone feared and respected by all the sailors on the Crimson Coast, regardless of nationality. It is said that she can commune with the dead, control the winds, and stop a man dead in his tracks with just a glance.	CC-027	None	N/A
Crew	028	The Stump	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	2	Common	Place this crew face up during setup. Reduce the cost of all other crew placed on this ship by 1.	No one knows how The Stump got his peg leg, but most are happy to buy him as many rounds as it takes to hear the latest version of the tale. He's an excellent source of gossip about the latest goings-on around the Crimson Coast, and he might even know something about the 'Eye of the Dragon'-or so he says.	CC-028	None	N/A
Crew	029_1	Le Requin	1	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	3	Common	Once per turn before you give this ship an action, roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, this ship may be given the same action twice.	The mannerisms, language facility, and learned nature of the dashing Le Requin hint at a previous life of privilege. Le Requin won his first ship from Bones Wiley in a dice game, and he has proven himself a brilliant tactician and natural leader. He is on a collision course with Hawkins over the affections of the Lady De Sol.	CC-029_1	None	N/A
Crew	029_2	Jonah	1	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	0	Common	Always place this crew face up; it cannot be eliminated unless its ship sinks. Crew placed on this ship cost no points, but they always each take up one cargo space. When this ship is hit, roll a d6. On a result of 5 or 6, move the crew on this ship with the highest point cost to a wild island chosen by the player to your left.	Joe didn't know who she was when he stole her meager possessions, but he would never forget the Hag of Tortuga after she cursed him. Trouble now follows Joe-and anyone around him-like lightning follows thunder. Thus he is constantly on the move (before people kill him), and he has changed his name to escape his reputation.	CC-029_2	None	N/A
Crew	030_1	Bloody Jake	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	3	Common	This ship gets +1 to her boarding rolls.	Bloody Jake has no trouble taking orders from Havana Black. An accomplished master of torture with a variety of implements, he genuinely enjoys carrying out his captain's commands-especially when it involves administering punishment or 'encouraging' captured seamen to join Havana's bloodthirsty crew.	CC-030_1	Havana Black	N/A
Crew	030_2	Maurice Aristide	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	3	Common	One of this ship's treasures is worth +2 gold when unloaded at your home island.	Hiding behind a ridiculous facade of heavy court makeup and a high wig, Maurice Aristide appears every bit the foppishly perfumed and helpless French courtier. In truth, he is a brilliant businessman with the knowledge both to find treasure on the Crimson Coast and to traffic it safely to his European accounts.	CC-030_2	Phillipe du Brissac	N/A
Fort	031	Dead Man's Point	1	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	0	Common	(3 Gold) When this fort hits a ship, you may also eliminate one cargo from that ship.	The fort at Dead Man's Point on the pirate island of Tortuga is a deadly surprise to ships moving slowly to avoid being grounded on the maze of reefs surrounding her harbor.	CC-031	4	0		3L,3L,3L,3L	
Ship	032	HMS Goliath	0	0	English	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	13	Rare	This ship gets +1 to her cannon rolls against French ships.	The Goliath suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the French on her maiden voyage, and so Captain Sinclair and the crew have sworn to avenge the honor of their beloved ship.	CC-032	5	5	L	3S,3L,3L,3L,3S	
Ship	033	HMS Viceroy	0	0	English	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	11	Uncommon	This ship cannot be pinned.	Bitter experience taught Captain Williams to never let his ship become entangled by a pirate or enemy ship, so he outfits every crewman with a hatchet and standing orders to abandon all other duties to use them as needed.	CC-033	4	4	L	3S,3L,3L,3S	
Ship	034	HMS London	0	0	English	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	11	Uncommon	When touching a Pirate ship, this ship may load as much of that ship's treasure as she can carry.	Much of the London's crew was pressed into service from among the brawny stevedores working the London docks, hence their skill and speed in loading their ship with captured booty.	CC-034	4	4	S,S	2S,2L,2L,2S	
Ship	035	HMS Ajax	0	0	English	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	12	Uncommon	Broadsides Attack.	Captain Maschile benefits from the rigorous training provided by Captain Blake to his crew, many of whom sailed with Blake--until they won assignment to another ship. He relies less on the lash, but has maintained his crew's deadly skill at broadsides.	CC-035	3	4	S,S	3S,3L,3S	
Ship	036	HMS Lord Lineton	0	0	English	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	14	Common	Schooner. This ship may dock at an enemy home island and load one treasure. If able, she must leave on your next turn.	Made in the Americas, this new schooner design is among the fastest on the Crimson Coast. The HMS Lord Lineton excels at disguising herself to look like whatever she is not.	CC-036	3	3	L	2S,2L,2S	
Ship	037	HMS Sultan	0	0	English	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	13	Common	Schooner. All of this ship's cannons have L range.	HMS Sultan's gunnery crews were all hand-trained by Weaponsmaster Charles Southwyn, which guarantees they know how to get the most out of the cannons he designed.	CC-037	3	5	L	3S,3S,3S	
Ship	038	HMS Cumberland	0	0	English	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	5	Common	Pirate ships get +1 to their cannon rolls against this ship.	The pirate Joffrey Flores stole the Cumberland from the Crown, and she was stolen from him by the Calico Cat, who returned the ship to the Crown in exchange for an imprisoned member of her crew. Flores has offered a reward to the pirate who can sink her for good.	CC-038	2	4	L	2S,2L	
Ship	039	HMS Gibraltar	0	0	English	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	12	Common	This ship may dock at an enemy home island and load one treasure. If able, she must leave on your next turn.	HMS Gibraltar is a slyly humorous nickname given to it by her crew. The 'Rock' is currently the fastest ship in the fleet and uses its speed and stealth to great effect against the Spanish.	CC-039	2	3	S,S,S	2S,2S	
Ship	040	HMS Alexander	0	0	English	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	8	Common	This ship gets +1 to her cannon rolls against French ships.	The captain of the Alexander looks for skill and experience in his crew, but also for a hatred of the French that matches the intensity of his own.	CC-040	2	4	S,L	3S,3S	
Ship	041	HMS Lady Provost	0	0	English	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	13	Common	Schooner. This ship may dock at an enemy home island and load one treasure. If able, she must leave on your next turn.	Captain DeLancey's decision to name his schooner for his married mistress, Lady Provost Helena Morency, caused such a scandal in England that he was forced to leave the continent.	CC-041	2	6	S,L	4S,4S	
Ship	042	HMS Swiftsure	0	0	English	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	10	Rare	L-range cannons cannot hit this ship.	Originally owned as a private yacht by the Owen family, the HMS Swiftsure was the price of Gryffin's commission in the Royal Navy. The Swiftsure is a flush-decked sloop, difficult for other ships to target at long range.	CC-042	1	2	L,L	2S	
Crew	043	Captain Percival Blake	1	0	English	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	7	Rare	Broadsides Attack. This ship may move and shoot using the same move action.	Captain Blake is a strict disciplinarian who uses the lash to urge his gun crews to perfect their skills. His excessive use of the lash may, in fact, be creating more pirates from his crew then he is catching. Percival Blake sees himself as Temple's rival suitor for Countess Doone's attentions, but while she takes his gifts, she does not take him seriously.	CC-043	None	N/A
Crew	044	Commodore Rhys Gryffin Owen	0	0	English	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	6	Rare	Once at the beginning of each of your turns, roll a d6. On a result of 6, any ship in your fleet may be given two actions that turn.	Owen's rich merchant family has never been accepted into society, so he went to sea to change his social standing. His unique command style of scanty discipline and huge cash rewards for success is possible only by paying his crew from his own pocket. Being a social climber himself, he has figured out Diana Doone's little secret, but since he has not revealed it, some arrangement must have been made.	CC-044	None	N/A
Crew	045	Dr. Forbes Beattie	1	0	English	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	5	Common	When another face-up crew on this ship is would be eliminated turn it face down instead.	Dr. Beattie is famous throughout the fleet for being able to save wounded men who other ship's doctors would have let die. Lucky for any crew on which Dr. Beattie serves, the wise Londoner reads current medical books and prefers to use herbal remedies, including some from distant China, instead of leeches and boiling oil.	CC-045	None	N/A
Crew	046_1	Cameron the Cabin Boy	0	0	English	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	3	Common	This crew takes up no cargo space when revealed. When revealed, put a crew with point cost 2 or less from outside of the game onto this ship.	Cameron had dreamed of going to sea since he was a wee lad growing up on the docks of Glasgow. He stowed away and remained undetected until hunger drove him to raid the ship's stores, but has quickly proven himself as one of the hardest-working members of the crew. Rumors allege that he is an illegitimate son of Admiral Morgan.	CC-046_1	None	N/A
Crew	046_2	Administror Scott Bratley	0	0	English	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	0	Common	Limit. Ransom. Place this crew face up during setup. You may build your fleet using 5 more points than the game's build total. This crew cannot leave this ship unless captured or eliminated.	Scott Bratley is Governor Lynch's secret to keeping the Empire's interests prospering in the Caribbean. Administrator Bratley is solely responsible for the smooth working of the fleet and the thriving trade, and seems able to summon resources out of thin air.	CC-046_2	None	N/A
Fort	047	Fort Brompton	0	0	English	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	0	Common	(3 Gold) This fort gets +1 to its cannon rolls when a ship is docked at it.	Fort Brompton is constantly short on soldiers, especially gunnery crews. Many rumors try to explain this, from cannibals on the island to seduction by the native girls, but the truth may simply be that the strategically placed fort has seen more than its share of deadly combat.	CC-047	4	0		3L,3L,3L,3L	
Ship	048	El Neptuno	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	12	Rare	You may double the range of this ship's cannons each turn, but you must roll a 6 to hit.	The flagship of El Duque Rafael de Moreno y Rivera, El Neptuno is a tightly run ship. But out of their master's sight, the devout Catholic crew readily petitions the sea god to guide their cannonballs to the target.	CC-048	5	5	S,S	4L,4L,4L,4L,4L	
Ship	049	El Argonauta	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	15	Rare	Broadsides Attack.	The crew of The Argonauta believe their ship's name to be a curse. Perhaps because the crew identifies with the Argonauts of legend, their skills are well-honed, allowing them to destroy a target ship with a single salvo.	CC-049	5	5	L	4S,4L,4L,4L,4S	
Ship	050	La Santa Ana	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	12	Uncommon	This ship gets +1 to her cannon rolls against French ships.	While on pirate patrol along the Crimson Coast, the virulently anti-French crew nearly mutinied in order to force the captain to abandon the pirate ship they were chasing and pursue a French target instead.	CC-050	4	6	S,S	4S,4L,4L,4S	
Ship	051	Matthias Vospero	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	12	Uncommon	This ship gets +1 to her cannon rolls against English ships.	Capitan Raphael Vospero has taken a vow to avenge his brother, whose ship was sunk by the HMS Viceroy. Vospero uses his access to naval intelligence reports to mask his quest as service to the Crown.	CC-051	4	4	S,S	3S,3L,3L,3S	
Ship	052	El Rayo	1	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	17	Uncommon	This ship gets +1 to her cannon rolls for every friendly ship within S of her.	Built as sister ships, El Trueno (Thunder) and El Rayo (Lightning) made a deadly combination, with both ships' crews performing better when the other was there for support. El Trueno disappeared about six months ago.	CC-052	3	3	S,L	4S,4S,4S	
Ship	053	La Trinidad	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	9	Uncommon	On the turn this ship is pinned, eliminate one crew from the enemy ship.	The captain of La Trinidad benefits from a secular trinity formed of himself, Master Bianco, and Countess Amore to smuggle artifacts, rare woods and treasure along the Monkey River.	CC-053	3	4	L	4S,4L,4S	
Ship	054	La Bahama	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	12	Common	Schooner. This ship may dock at an enemy home island and load one treasure. If able, she must leave on your next turn.	The schooner La Bahama can dance across shoals that would bottom out larger, heavier ships, giving her the advantage when sailing among the hundreds of small islands in search of the legendary Gold Coral Caves.	CC-054	3	3	L	4S,4S,4S	
Ship	055	El San Francisco	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	8	Common	When touching a Pirate ship, this ship may load as much of that ship's treasure as she can carry.	If it takes a thief to catch a thief, such may be the case with the captain and crew of El San Francisco, for they seem unnaturally gifted at relieving pirates of their stolen booty.	CC-055	2	5	S,S	2L,2S	
Ship	056	El Montañez	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	9	Common	Once per turn, if this ship carries treasure and is within S of an enemy ship, you may randomly trade one treasure with that ship.	The capitan of El Montañez is an enterprising man. He reasons that sometimes it's better to barter than fight, a philosophy his crew appreciates when they see the shiny doubloons stored in the hold.	CC-056	2	3	S,S	2S,2S	
Ship	057	El San Salvador	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	8	Common	Schooner. Forts cannot hit this ship.	The mute capitan has trained his crew to work in complete silence. That quality, added to the schooner's sleek design, fuels the rumor that the ship can transform into a bird to slip past its enemies.	CC-057	2	3	S,L	2S,2S	
Ship	058	La Rosario	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	6	Rare	This ship cannot be pinned.	La Rosario nimbly dodges the attempts of enemy ships to pin her, a skill perhaps inspired by the dashing young captain's relationship with the lovely Lady Arcadia de Sol.	CC-058	1	2	S,S,S	3S	
Crew	059	El Duque Rafael de Moreno y Rivera	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	6	Rare	Once per turn, roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, this ship may be given an extra action.	Rafael el Duque de Moreno y Rivera comes from a family made proud and rich from battles with the Moors. The current duke is incensed that Capitan Alarico Castro is in command of one of the largest Spanish ships in the Caribbean, rather than in chains, and he is constantly looking for an excuse to put the man where he belongs.	CC-059	None	N/A
Crew	060	Contessa Anita Amore	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	0	Common	Limit. Ransom. Place this crew face up during setup. You may build your fleet using 5 more points than the game's build total. This crew cannot leave this ship unless captured or eliminated.	After two nearly fatal 'accidents' at home (possibly arranged by her husband's children, all older than her), the lovely Contessa Anita decided that it might be prudent to take a long trip until her husband passes away and she inherits everything. She has been seen in the company of both Caballero Luys de Alva and the pirate Jack Hawkins.	CC-060	None	N/A
Crew	061	Inquisitor Sebastián Blanco	1	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	2	Common	Place this crew face up during setup. Reduce the cost of all other crew placed on this ship by 1.	Don Sebastián de la Peña resigned his commission as a career soldier to take up the cause of the Inquisition. His passion for his work burns clearly in his eyes. Even so, the crew with whom he serves finds it remarkably easy to discuss personal matters with the war veteran, who is really using them all as spies to find Jews and heretics.	CC-061	None	N/A
Crew	062_1	Doctor Urbano Javier	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	4	Common	When another face-up crew on this ship is would be eliminated turn it face down instead.	Doctor Urbano Javier signed on as ship's doctor in hopes of finding a cure for the virulent plague that killed his family. Amazingly, rather than being bitter about his loss, he is a kind, gentle man who cares deeply about each and every patient.	CC-062_1	None	N/A
Crew	062_2	Agustín Covas	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	3	Common	This ship ignores terrain when she is given a move action (islands are not terrain).	Born and raised in Portugal, Agustín Covas attended the prestigious navigation school founded by Columbus' navigator. He sailed for the New World to distance himself from the Inquisition, but it followed, and he lives in fear of being discovered as a Jew. Olano is compelled to find enough gold to save his people, and so seeks the mythical city of El Dorado.	CC-062_2	None	N/A
Fort	063	El Castillo del Infanta	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	0	Common	(3 Gold) Once per turn, one of this fort's cannons may shoot again if it misses.	El Castillo del Infanta (Castle of the Princess) was designed to protect Lady Arcadia De Sol from the wicked world around her. Her father spared no expense, including hiring the best and most determined gunners, but ultimately it was all for naught, because the lovely lady's own desires were stronger than the stone walls constructed by her father.	CC-063	5	0		4L,4L,4L,4L,4L	
Fort	064	El Puerto Blanco	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	0	Common	(3 Gold) A ship docks here may use its action to look at one face-down cargo on each island.	The Escuela de Cartografia in Puerto Blanco is home to one of the greatest map collections in the world. There are legends that the maps from the library of Alexandria in ancient Egypt reside in its amazing vaults. Tended by a monastic order of mysterious origin, the thousands of maps are rumored to include the map to El Dorado.	CC-064	3	0		3L,3L,3L	
Ship	065	La Magnifique	1	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	17	Rare	Broadsides Attack.	Not every ship can live up to the name 'La Magnifique,' but with Capitaine de St. Croix in command, this ship is just that-nigh invincible when delivering a full cannon barrage.	CC-065	5	6	L	3S,3L,3L,3L,3S	
Ship	066	La Ville de Paris	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	16	Rare	This ship ignores the first hit she takes each turn as long as she has all of her masts.	Like a true Parisian lady of fashion, La Ville de Paris usually dismisses the first insult from an opposing ship-but woe betide the foe who presumes to fires a second shot!	CC-066	5	5	S	2S,2L,2L,2L,2S	
Ship	067	Le Dauphin Royal	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	14	Rare	This ship gets +1 to her cannon rolls against English ships.	Le Dauphin Royal carries both the name and the patronage of the royal family, and her loyal crew take seriously their responsibility of maintaining the honor of the nation.	CC-067	5	5	L	3S,2L,2L,2L,3S	
Ship	068	La Possession	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	13	Uncommon	If this ship has a Captain crew, she gets +1 to her cannon rolls.	First Mate Claude Sevigny is an imposing man, both intellectually and physically. His vast maritime knowledge comes not from study but from experience sailing among the hundreds of islands under flags with fewer colors than France's.	CC-068	4	4	S,S	3S,3L,3L,3S	
Ship	069	L'Hercule	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	22	Uncommon	This ship's cannons may not be eliminated (masts still may be). If derelict, she cannot shoot.	The crew of L'Hercule wrestle to determine the 'Strongest Man Aboard' for the duration of that tour of duty. Bo'sun Bertrand le Geant is prepared to defend his title against all comers.	CC-069	4	3	S,S	3S,2L,2L,3S	
Ship	070	Le St. Michel	1	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	10	Uncommon	This ship gets +1 to her boarding rolls.	As feared as the ship is, her meticulously dressed-yet ferocious-crew is even more reviled. For a drink, The Stump will tell stories about atrocities committed 'in defense of France.'	CC-070	3	3	S,L	3S,3L,3S	
Ship	071	Le Duc de Bourgogne	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	11	Uncommon	This ship gets +1 to her cannon rolls against Pirate ships.	The crew of Le Duc de Bourgogne claim to have sunk more pirate ships than any other vessel on the Crimson Coast. Pirate captains everywhere yearn to sink the ship-with her crew tied to their own cannons.	CC-071	3	4	S,S	3L,3S,3S	
Ship	072	Le Marseillais	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	14	Uncommon	When touching a Pirate ship, this ship may load as much of that ship's treasure as she can carry.	Chef Perier believes that garlic cures anything-even scurvy-so the crew of the jaunty Le Marseillais are known for the distinctive odor that rises as they sweat from loading treasure.	CC-072	3	4	S,L	2L,3S,3S	
Ship	073	L'Auguste	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	13	Uncommon	This ship may dock at an enemy home island and load one treasure. If able, she must leave on your next turn.	The haughty L'Auguste will sail into any port-even the heavily gunned El Castillo del Infanta-and take whatever she wants, ignoring minor matters such as allegiance.	CC-073	3	4	S,S	4S,2L,4S	
Ship	074	L'Orient	1	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	10	Common	Schooner. Forts cannot hit this ship.	Rumor has it that 'Cold Draft' ArathiIel protects L'Orient using a Chinese talisman, but no one knows for sure-she's never been boarded, and asking Starcher about it would be unwise.	CC-074	3	3	L	3S,3L,3S	
Ship	075	Le Triton	1	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	10	Common	Schooner. This ship cannot be pinned.	In combat, a member of Le Triton's crew blows the battle call on a huge conch shell to inspire the men. Geoffrey Flores covets her and the seemingly magical seashell as trophies.	CC-075	3	5	S,L	3S,3L,4S	
Ship	076	La Cleopatre	2	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	12	Common	Schooner. This ship may dock at an enemy home island and load one treasure. If able, she must leave on your next turn.	Gossipmongers claim that the ship's startlingly lifelike figurehead, modeled after the famous queen of Egypt, is instead based on Vicomtesse de Richelieu, who posed for the sculptor.	CC-076	3	3	L	2S,3L,3S	
Ship	077	La Provence	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	8	Common	When this ship hits another ship, you choose which mast is eliminated.	Amiral Dupuy spends long hours determining the best angles of attack. He is particularly adept at using La Provence's guns to cripple ships resistant to ramming, such as El Leon.	CC-077	2	3	S,L	2S,2S	
Ship	078	L'Intrepide	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	5	Common	English ships get +1 to their cannon rolls against this ship.	The English reserve a special hatred for L'Intrepide, who true to her name goes where others fear to tread-most especially among English Royal fleet.	CC-078	2	4	S,L	3S,3S	
Ship	079	L'Amazone	1	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	9	Common	This ship gets +1 to her cannon rolls against Spanish ships.	Capitaine de Heiron believes, as did his Norman ancestors, that everything in Spain actually belongs to France, and it is his duty to ensure that the stolen property is returned to its original owner.	CC-079	2	4	S,L	3S,4S	
Ship	080	Le Mercure	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	9	Common	Schooner. This ship cannot be pinned.	Le Mercure has mastered the art of evasion, moving through enemy lines as though she were wearing the winged shoes of the messenger of the gods himself.	CC-080	2	2	S,S,S	2S,2S	
Ship	081	L'Artesien	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	8	Rare	Once per turn, if this ship carries treasure and is within S of an enemy ship, you may randomly trade one treasure with that ship.	Some members of L'Artesien's crew know a little too much about piracy, though none have breached protocol. But Amiral Dupuy knows that Monsieur LeNoir has been leaving the ship at odd hours of the night.	CC-081	1	4	S,S,S	4S	
Ship	082	Le Solitaire	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	17	Rare	Friendly ships within S of this ship get +1 to their cannon rolls.	France's allies are gladdened upon seeing Le Solitaire, for it means the powerful fleet is nearby. The little scout benefits from both good sailing and intelligence gained from Maurice Aristide's spy network.	CC-082	1	1	L	5L	
Ship	083	Le Colibri	1	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	7	Rare	L-range cannons cannot hit this ship.	Le Colibri flits about the sea just like her hummingbird Namesake. Capitaine Arnaud, the Hag of Tortuga's godson, knows the currents and winds better than any other French-born captain in the fleet.	CC-083	1	3	S	3S	
Crew	084	Amiral Stephan Dupuy	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	5	Rare	Once per turn, roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, this ship may be given an extra action.	Given the choice, Amiral Dupuy would much rather wear an ordinary sailor's attire than his fussy dress uniform, and he prefers to stand on the deck of his ship in a raging storm than to attend tedious staff meetings in Paris. Truly a sailor's sailor, Dupuy's experience and intelligence have proved him worthy of his rank.	CC-084	None	N/A
Crew	085	Capitaine Gaston de St. Croix	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	5	Rare	Once per turn before you give this ship an action, roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, this ship may be given the same action twice. This ship gets +1 to her cannon rolls against English ships.	The bold Capitaine Gaston de St. Croix is a member of one of France's oldest and most honored families, and his dashing good looks and forays against the English have caught the eye of Vicomtesse de Richelieu. Because she outranks him, it's quite possible that her interest is personal. Her attention has thus far been discreet, but that may change soon.	CC-085	None	N/A
Crew	086	Vicomtesse Angelique de Richelieu	1	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	3	Rare	Once per turn, this ship may randomly take one treasure from any ship she touches.	Vicomtesse Angelique de Richelieu's exquisite beauty belies a dangerously cunning mind. Clever and well-connected, she has established an intricate spy network whose tentacles reach all the way back to France. It is not known whether her relationship with the shadowy Monsieur LeNoir is romantic or professional, but it's safer not to inquire.	CC-086	Monsieur LeNoir	N/A
Crew	087	Claude Perier	2	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	3	Common	This crew takes up no cargo space when revealed. When revealed, put a crew with point cost 2 or less from outside of the game onto this ship.	The first time Claude Perier poked at a steaming pot, his wise mother apprenticed him to the best chef she could find, and he sauteed and flambeed his way to the Royal Court itself. When asked how he ended up cooking in a cramped galley, he merely shrugs, but rumors of duels, poisonings, and revenge abound.	CC-087	None	N/A
Crew	088	Monsieur LeNoir	1	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	5	Common	Once per turn, one crew or ship within S of this ship cannot use its ability that turn.	Despite rumors of nobility, Monsieur LeNoir prefers to cultivate a quiet and understated persona. Although never at the forefront of events, some speculate that he orchestrates them anyway, as he has ties to almost everyone. Always dressed impeccably in black, he has many lady admirers, who find his dark good looks deliciously menacing.	CC-088	Vicomtesse Angelique de Richelieu	N/A
Crew	089	Vicomte Jules de Cissey	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	0	Common	Limit. Ransom. Place this crew face up during setup. You may build your fleet using 5 more points than the game's build total. This crew cannot leave this ship unless captured or eliminated.	Not everyone who wears a fancy uniform deserves it-especially not Vicomte Jules de Cissey. Every inch the powdered puppy, his shrill demands and pretentious behavior make him generally disliked by all who meet him. He is, however, a vicomte with means, so he continues to receive his social due, though his presence adds no luster to events.	CC-089	None	N/A
Crew	090	Capitaine Arathiel	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	5	Common	This ship may move and shoot using the same move action. Once per turn, you may eliminate one of this ship's crew to give her an extra action.	Whatever burns in Roy 'Cold Draft' Arathilel's heart is more brimstone than blood, and some believe he is actually more demon than man. His reputation for cruelty surpasses even that of some of the most well-known and feared pirates on the Crimson Coast. To know 'Cold Draft' is to fear him, which is exacly the way he likes it.	CC-090	None	N/A
Crew	090_1	Phillipe du Brissac	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	2	Common	Place this crew face up during setup. Reduce the cost of all other crew placed on this ship by 1.	Phillipe du Brissac makes a living luring ambitious men into the French navy, promising to introduce them to those with influence and power. By the time they see through his charade, they are out to sea, though it's only a matter of time before someone exposes him for the poseur he is. Fortunately, he is partially sheltered by his good friend, Maurice Aristide.	CC-090_1	Maurice Aristide	N/A
Fort	091	St. Pierre	0	0	French	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	0	Common	(3 Gold) If a ship docks at this fort and unloads at least 4 gold, it may be given a second action that turn.	Informed captains know that when they dock at the port of St. Pierre, a little extra gold ensures that their cargo will be unloaded swiftly-and without a lot of questions.	CC-091	5	0		4L,4L,4L,4L,4L	
Treasure	092	Scurvy	2	0	null	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	0	Rare	Roll a d6 at the beginning of each of your turns. On results of 4-6, eliminate a crew on this ship. Remove Scurvy from the game when this ship docks at her home island.		654433211

Treasure	097	Grease Barrels	0	0	null	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	0	Rare	Load this treasure face down. On any one of your turns, you may turn Grease Barrels face up to give this ship +S to her base move that turn. If you do, remove Grease Barrels from the game.		654433211
Treasure	098	Abandoned Crew	0	0	null	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	0	Rare	When placing treasure, you may place one or more of these crew rather than a treasure, on a one-for-one basis; you must still place the required value of gold.

Treasure	099	Ghostly Encounter	1	0	null	Pirates of the Crimson Coast	0	Rare	Once after revealing, roll a d6 for each crew on the ship. On a result of 1, that crew is eliminated. Ghostly Encounter is worth gold equal to the crew remaining on the ship after all dice are rolled.		654433211

Crew	GC-001	El Fantasma	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Spanish Main	3	Limited Edition	This ship may dock at an enemy home island and load one treasure. If able, she must leave on your next turn.	Some claim that El Fantasma is nothing but a clever captain with a bag of tricks, but they have never seen right through him as he screamed like a banshee while cutting a man in two. That kind of thing makes you believe in the supernatural!	GC-001	None	N/A
Crew	GC-003	Ghost Crew	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Spanish Main	6	Limited Edition	This ship's crew cannot be eliminated unless she sinks.

When the Revenant appeared, Capitan Alberto Ladron's crew was paralyzed by their superstitious fear. When El Fantasma offered to 'borrow' the ship rather than destroy her, Ladron had no choice but to accede. El Fantasma used her to sneak into and sack the Spanish port of Cuba. True to his word, the apparition returned Ladron's ship with a handshake. Ladron now believes in ghosts - and his right hand is still numb.	GS-003	4	4	L	2S,3L,3L,2S

Ship	GS-006	HMS Wycliffe	0	0	English	Pirates of the Spanish Main	9	Limited Edition	Ramming cannot eliminate this ship's masts.	Unfortunately, the thick hull of the HMS Wycliffe matched the thick skull of her captain. He was stupid enough to boast that his ship could withstand anything the Revenant could throw at her.

Crew	PC-006	Ghost Crew	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Spanish Main	6	Common	This ship's crew cannot be eliminated unless she sinks.	Some say the Ghost Crew are damned men cursed to sail these waters until they send enough souls to hell to get theirs back.

Crew	PC-007	David 'Bones' Wiley	0	0	Pirates	Pirates of the Spanish Main	3	Common	Once per turn, if this ship carries treasure and is within S of an enemy ship, you may randomly trade one treasure with that ship.

On a 5 or 6, this ship may be given the same action twice.	Castro is a dedicated man, but ultimately not to Spain. He 'overcame' his Moorish heritage to rise to the top of the Spanish Navy, but he plots against every Castilian who has wronged him. Castro does his duty, but he patiently waits to make his move.	SC-001	Castro's Loyalists	N/A
Crew	SC-002	Comandante Luys de Alva	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	3	Rare	This ship gets +1 to her cannon rolls against English ships.	Some say that de Alva's influential parents are the reason for his rapid climb in the Spanish Navy; these people do not know de Alva. His singular vision is to rid the Spanish Main of foreign holdings, starting with the English and the pirates they sponsor. De Alva's biggest weakness is becoming too 'involved' with his 'prizes.'	SC-002	None	N/A
Crew	SC-003	Master Gunner Rogelio Vazquez	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	5	Common	All of this ship's cannons have L range.	Vazquez can hit a wine glass with a cannonball at 500 yards.

Crew	SC-005	Fernando Sanchez	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	5	Common	This ship may dock at an enemy home island and load one treasure. If able, she must leave on your next turn.	Sanchez uses information smuggled to him by Nemesio Diaz to raid enemy ports when they are most laden with gold. Sanchez has put a price on Hawkins' head for tricking his galleon onto a reef, and he's doubled that price for Hawkins' monkey, Skyme. His expensive hatred of the monkey remains unexplained.	SC-005	Nemesio Diaz	N/A
Crew	SC-006	Almirante Devante del Nero	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	3	Common	This ship gets +1 to her cannon rolls against Pirate ships.	Almirante del Nero, commander of the Armada de Barlavento, is a man driven almost mad by his zeal to rid the Spanish Main of pirates. To fail will be to fail his duty to God.

Crew	SC-007	Castro's Loyalists	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	2	Uncommon	This ship gets +1 to her boarding rolls.	Over the years, Capitan Castro has surrounded himself with loyal crew.

Crew	SC-009	Bianco's Haulers	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	3	Common	This ship may unload cargo at your home island if she's within S of it.	Master Bianco has a small fleet that shuttles his secret stores from the ships in the middle of the night.

Crew	SC-010	Nemesio Diaz	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	5	Common	Once per turn, cancel the ability of one crew or ship within S of this ship.	Nemesio Diaz (aka William Cob, Jean Parisot la Valette, and Michel van Horn) is a true son of Spain, but he spends most of his time spying on the aristocracy of Spain's enemies. He works to defeat any who would plunder the riches that are Spain's by papal decree; that is, all of the Americas.	SC-010	Fernando Sanchez	N/A
Crew	SC-011	Gonzalo Mora	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	2	Common	When this ship hits another ship, you choose which mast is eliminated.	Capitan Mora is a shark who prefers surgical strikes to the blundering tactics of the English. His instincts about the weak spot of a fleet or ship are amazing, allowing his gunners to do more damage with a single shot than other crews might do with several broadsides.	SC-011	None	N/A
Crew	SC-012	Comandante Antonio de Silva	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	2	Common	Once per turn when this ship hits an enemy ship, also eliminate one crew from that ship.

Ship	SS-001	El Acorazado	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	21	Rare	Two hits from the same shoot action are required to eliminate one of this ship's masts.	The captain of 'The Battleship,' pride of the Spanish fleet and perhaps the strongest ship ever built, claims that not even the devil himself could sink her.

Ship	SS-004	La Repulsa	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	14	Rare	This ship gets +1 to her cannon rolls for every friendly ship within S of her.

Ship	SS-005	La Joya del Sol	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	12	Uncommon	This ship gets +1 to her boarding rolls.	An imposing armed merchant ship, 'The Jewel of the Sun' can move quickly with a large cargo.

Ship	SS-006	El Tirador	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	8	Uncommon	Once per turn when this ship hits an enemy ship, also eliminate one crew from that ship.

Ship	SS-007	L'Aguila	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	12	Uncommon	When touching a Pirate ship, this ship may load as much of that ship's treasure as she can carry.	Under Capitan Alarico Castro, 'The Eagle' has earned a fearsome reputation. Castro's crew has perfected the art of ransacking and destroying their pirate enemies. It is rumored that he keeps a portion of the spoils hidden from Spain.	SS-007	4	5	L	3S,2L,2L,3S	
Ship	SS-008	Cazador del Pirata	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	11	Uncommon	This ship gets +1 to her cannon rolls against Pirate ships.

Ship	SS-009	La Resolucion	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	12	Uncommon	Once per turn, this ship may randomly take one treasure from any ship she touches.

Ship	SS-011	La Furia	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	12	Common	This ship eliminates two masts with one hit.	Although 'The Fury' was outfitted with the same cannons as the Asesino de la Nave, she does not perform as well at short range, a fact that can be attributed only to the quality of her gun crew.	SS-011	2	3	L	3S,3S	
Ship	SS-012	El Duque	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	11	Common	If this ship has a Captain crew, she gets +1 to her cannon rolls.

Ship	SS-013	Pescados de Plata	1	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	8	Common	Once per turn, this ship may move S after unloading cargo.	The 'Silver Fish' is fast and agile. Her crews are all ex-merchant sailors, and so they are expert cargo handlers	SS-013	2	3	S,S	2S,2S	
Ship	SS-014	El Corazon del Mar	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	8	Common	If derelict, this ship gains a base move of S.	The crew of 'The Heart of the Sea' certainly live up to their ship's name: They put their hearts and backs into anything they do.	SS-014	3	3	L	2S,4L,2S

Ship	SS-016	El Leon	0	0	Spanish	Pirates of the Spanish Main	9	Common	Ramming cannot eliminate this ship's masts.

Arazure could not have asked for greater glory for the tri-colors than attacking and destroying the English. In war, his cruelty and savagery are masked by the necessity of combat.
